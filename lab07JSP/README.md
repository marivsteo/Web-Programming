Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. Write a web application which allows two (human) players to play the game X-0. The game can not start unless two playes are connected. If a third player comes in, it will be rejected from the game with an error message. Users must authenticate themselfs prior to entering the game (based on username/password).
